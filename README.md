# Set a Light

Given the increasing use of satellites in technology, it is very important to make knowledge on this subject more accessible and interesting for the population. There is an expressive amount of satellites with the most diverse purposes helping the population and, with them, the proposal of the "Set a Light" app arises as a way to take this knowledge into people's homes. Set a Light" focuses on learning about satellites for children, using an educational and practical approach. This learning will highlight important characteristics about the history of satellites, what their types are and what can be done through them today, all this using an illustrated storytelling suitable for children to understand this technology in a simple way. As for the practical approach, the application will have a game mode where it will be possible, through the camera of the cell phone, to find unknown satellites that will appear using augmented reality features. When finding an unknown satellite, the child can select it to read its main information such as name, type, function and, if available, a picture of what its view of the earth looks like. In addition, the game will have a satellite album that will be updated with each new satellite found, being possible to see the information of each satellite registered.
